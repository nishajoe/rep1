Kerala is one of the most scenic and popular tourist destinations in India. It is also famous for its special ayurvedic therapies and its backwaters. Kerala also leads other states in Industrial development and per capita income. The state is a significant exporter of coir, spices, marine products, cashew, coffee and pickles. New business opportunities in Kerala can be explored as two-thirds of the state's export income comes from the food processing industry.

With a coastline of nearly 590 km, Kerala has a major port at Kochi (with a cruise terminal) and 16 smaller ports along the coast. Potential investors can identify many new investment opportunities in Kerala. The state is very close to the global maritime trade route passing through the Indian Ocean region with Kochi International Container Trans-shipment Terminal (ICT) at Vallarpadam, India's first ICT. Kerala is the first state in India to have four international airports, namely in Kochi, Kozhikode, Thiruvananthapuram and Kannur.
